		<h1>Welcome to Bourbon & Booleans!</h1>
		<p>Thanks so much for stopping by - this is essentially free advertising for me to sell my skills to the Information Technology market... haha, kidding - sort of. I am enthusiastic about most things IT (with the exception of SAP - gasp) and so I am happy to share my skills, ideas, projects, and knowledge (or perhaps lack thereof) with anyone willing to listen. So take a minute, check out my page, and let me know what you think. Want to get in touch to brainstorm on a project? Host an old-school LAN party? Hire me? My contact information is below - drop me an e-mail! :)</p>
